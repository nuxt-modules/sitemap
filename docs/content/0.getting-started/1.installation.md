## Setup Module

Want to know why you might need this module? Check out the [introduction](/docs/sitemap/getting-started/introduction).

To get started with Nuxt Sitemap, you need to install the dependency and add it to your Nuxt config.

:ModuleInstall{name="@nuxtjs/sitemap"}

## Verifying Installation

After you've set up the module with the minimal config, you should be able to visit [`/sitemap.xml`](http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml) to see the generated sitemap.

You may notice that the URLs point to your `localhost` domain, this is to make navigating your local site easier, and will be updated when you deploy your site.

All pages preset are discovered from your [Application Sources](/docs/sitemap/getting-started/data-sources), for dynamic URLs see [Dynamic URLs](/docs/sitemap/guides/dynamic-urls).

You can debug this further in Nuxt DevTools under the Sitemap tab.

## Configuration

At a minimum the module requires a Site URL to be set, this is to ensure only your canonical domain is being used for
the sitemap. A site name can also be provided to customize the sitemap [stylesheet](/docs/sitemap/guides/customising-ui).

### Site Config Quick Setup

The easiest way to configure your site URL is using the [Nuxt Site Config](/docs/site-config/getting-started/introduction) module, which is automatically installed with `@nuxtjs/sitemap`.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  site: {
    url: 'https://example.com',
    name: 'My Awesome Site'
  }
})
```

Alternatively, you can configure the site URL directly in the sitemap module options:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sitemap: {
    siteUrl: 'https://example.com'
  }
})
```

Note: Using the `site` config is recommended as it provides site-wide configuration that can be used by other SEO modules.

To ensure search engines find your sitemap, you will need to add it to your robots.txt. It's recommended to use the [Nuxt Robots](/docs/robots/getting-started/installation) module for this.

:ModuleCard{slug="robots" class="w-1/2"}

Every site is different and will require their own further unique configuration, to give you a head start:

- [Dynamic URL Endpoint](/docs/sitemap/guides/dynamic-urls) - If you have dynamic URLs you need to add to the sitemap, you can use a runtime API endpoint. For example, if your
generating your site from a CMS.
- [Multi Sitemaps](/docs/sitemap/guides/multi-sitemaps) - If you have 10k+ pages, you may want to split your sitemap into multiple files
so that search engines can process them more efficiently.

You do not need to worry about any further configuration in most cases, check the [best practices](/docs/sitemap/guides/best-practices) guide for more information.
