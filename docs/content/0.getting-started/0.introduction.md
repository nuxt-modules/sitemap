## Why use Nuxt Sitemap?

Nuxt Sitemap is a module for generating XML Sitemaps with minimal configuration and best practice defaults.

The core output of this module is a [sitemap.xml](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview) file, which is used by search engines to understand the structure of your site and index it more effectively.

While it's not required to have a sitemap, it can be a powerful tool in getting your content indexed more frequently and more accurately,
especially for larger sites or sites with complex structures.

While it's simple to create your own sitemap.xml file, it can be time-consuming to keep it up-to-date with your site's content
and easy to miss best practices.

Nuxt Sitemap automatically generates the sitemap for you based on your site's content, including lastmod, image discovery and more.

## Installation

You have two installation options:

**Option 1: Install the full SEO suite** (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is by installing `@nuxtjs/seo`, which includes Nuxt Sitemap along with other essential SEO modules:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add seo
```

**Option 2: Install Nuxt Sitemap standalone**

If you only need sitemap functionality, you can install just the sitemap module:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add sitemap
```

Both options will work perfectly fine. The `@nuxtjs/seo` module is a collection of modules including sitemap, robots, og-image, and more.
