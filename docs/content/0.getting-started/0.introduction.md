## Why use Nuxt Sitemap?

Nuxt Sitemap is a module for generating XML Sitemaps with minimal configuration and best practice defaults.

The core output of this module is a [sitemap.xml](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview) file, which is used by search engines to understand the structure of your site and index it more effectively.

While it's not required to have a sitemap, it can be a powerful tool in getting your content indexed more frequently and more accurately,
especially for larger sites or sites with complex structures.

While it's simple to create your own sitemap.xml file, it can be time-consuming to keep it up-to-date with your site's content
and easy to miss best practices.

Nuxt Sitemap automatically generates the sitemap for you based on your site's content, including lastmod, image discovery and more.
